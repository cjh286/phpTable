Shin Ramyun;~;NongShim;~;Soup;~;Hot;~;Korean. This is the icon of Korean ramen. It is the default go to ramen. It's pretty spicy, but recently there have been some extremely spicy ramen, so it was classified as hot. This is the most common ramen in Korea. It's like the Kraft Mac and Cheese  of Korea, it's iconic. Add egg (highly recommended), kimchi, spam, vegetables, and pretty much anything you like. img 1: https://m.media-amazon.com/ images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/ 324801da-de8e-41b6-a7f7-741204253952.png. img 2: http://cfile27.uf.tistory.com/ image/21511049523622251AE5BA;~;https://info2300.coecis.cornell.edu/users/cjh286sp17/www/p2/img/shimramen.png;~;https://info2300.coecis.cornell.edu/users/cjh286sp17/www/p2/img/shimramen2.png;~;

Kyo Kyo Myun;~;Paldo;~;Soup;~;Mild;~;Korean. Clear white soup with chewy noodles, refreshing and filling (according to advertisements. Don't really know much about it.....) img 1: http://bokklers.com/ files/attach/images/2423/182/011/385e1a7417e12d6d1e0bd4d1c62661ae.jpg. img 2: http://pds22.egloos.com/ pds/201108/09/12/ c0055612_4e413abc54235.jpg;~;https://info2300.coecis.cornell.edu/users/cjh286sp17/www/p2/img/kyokyomyun.jpg;~;https://info2300.coecis.cornell.edu/users/cjh286sp17/www/p2/img/kyokyomyun2.jpg;~;
Ramen Noodle Soup Chicken;~;Maruchan;~;Soup;~;None;~;Japanese (I think? but widely distributed in America). Chicken flavored soup with noodles, not spicy at all. Perfect for children or someone who is sick with a cold and requires warm, salty fluids but also likes noodles. Sort of a like a cheap, unhealthy chicken noodle soup replacement. Never tried it before, because I only eat Korean ramen. The second picture makes it look really artsy and fancy. img 1: http://i.huffpost.com/ gadgets/slideshows/321384/ slide_321384_3015740_free.jpg. img 2: http://www.seriouseats.com/ images/2013/09/ 20130917-chicken-instant-ramen-taste-test-8.jpg;~;https://info2300.coecis.cornell.edu/users/cjh286sp17/www/p2/img/maruchan.jpg;~;https://info2300.coecis.cornell.edu/users/cjh286sp17/www/p2/img/maruchan2.jpg;~;
BulDak;~;SamYang;~;Sauce;~;Very;~;Korean. Known as one of the spiciest ramens in Korea. Name is literally fire chicken. I had it once. I thought my tongue was going to burn off. But apparently to some other Koreans (like my dad), its not spicy at all... (They are crazy). Cheese is commonly added to reduce the spiciness. Add egg, rice, seaweed, or other flavors. (PS, they sell this in the Korean Market in Collegetown,) img 1: http://oriwiki.net/ images/d/d8/ %EC%82%BC%EC%96%91_%EB%B6%88%EB%8 B%AD%EB%B3%B6%EC%9D%8C%EB%A9%B4_2560_1305_1118.jpg. img 2: http://hankookmart.com/ Product/Images/3/ SFSELFAA0003289/Editor/ 1113748095510cc1ee6178d.jpg;~;https://info2300.coecis.cornell.edu/users/cjh286sp17/www/p2/img/buldak.jpg;~;https://info2300.coecis.cornell.edu/users/cjh286sp17/www/p2/img/buldak2.jpg;~;

BiBimMyun;~;Paldo;~;Sauce;~;Hot;~;Korean. It's an instant version of the classic Korean noodle dish: BiBimMyun. It's cold noodles (rinsed in cold water) mixed with a spicy, sweet, and tangy sauce. Add a boiled egg on top and fresh vegetables to add flavor and aesthetic appeal (usually cucumbers are the best). It's pretty spicy, so be warned. My sister really likes this. Good for eating in the summer. img 1: http://cfs.tistory.com/ attach/3085/330941.jpg. img 2: http://cfile210.uf.daum.net/ image/2406564D53F45C4F33FCAD;~;https://info2300.coecis.cornell.edu/users/cjh286sp17/www/p2/img/bibimmyun.jpg;~;https://info2300.coecis.cornell.edu/users/cjh286sp17/www/p2/img/bibimmyun2.jpg;~;
